## Placeholder Images
The placeholder images have background color `#c5c5c5` and foreground `#ffffff`. They are made in GIMP from SVG files as follows:

- Create a background canvas of twice the required size (e.g. 900x500 for the 450x250 map placeholder), with the background color.
- Add the SVG in the right size (e.g. 400x400 for the map placeholder), and paint it to foreground color.
- Scale the imge to the right size.
- Save and export it tp PNG, unchecking any stored info, such as Exif or color profile. If the image does not need to be transparant, do check 'save background color' to reduce file size (the alpha channel is left out).

Some of them use SVGs of Material Design icons, that can be downloaded from <https://fonts.google.com/icons>.
